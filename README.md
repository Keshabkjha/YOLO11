# YOLO Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, Image Classification, Pose Estimation, Oriented Bounding Boxes Object Detection, Face detection
 
# YOLO Object Detection and Beyond


This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for various computer vision tasks, including:

- **Object Detection**
- **Instance Segmentation**
- **Image Classification**
- **Pose Estimation**
- **Oriented Bounding Boxes Object Detection**
- **Face Detection**

The implementation supports processing **images**, **videos**, **links**, and **real-time** detection. Everything is explained in detail in the provided Jupyter Notebook. Download and use it to explore the capabilities of YOLO!
